Do the following to set up:
1. Download Android Studio with all recommended extensions
2. Open this project folder
3. Test it by pressing the play button
4. You should see an emulator with "Hello V-Queue" on it

All code files go in the java folder and you can also code in Kotlin. I'm working on UI stuff ASAP
